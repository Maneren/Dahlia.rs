# Dahlia.rs

A Rust port of [Dahlia](https://github.com/trag1c/Dahlia) â€” a simple text formatting package, inspired by the game Minecraft.

Text is formatted in a similar way to in the game. With Dahlia, it is formatted by typing a special character `&` followed by a format code and finally the text to be formatted.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
dahlia = "1"
```

The documentation is available at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/dahlia/1.0.0/dahlia).
